# Session Mount Runtime

[Documentation index](README.md) · [简体中文](session-mount-runtime.md)

> This document is the runtime contract for **issue #879, "Refactor: standardise
> terminal-process mounting"**. It describes not how one screen behaves but the
> single set of rules governing the relationship between **sessions** and
> **processes** across the whole TUI.
> The screen lives in `src/screens/SessionSupervisor.tsx`; the occupancy
> protocol lives in `src/sessionMounts.ts`.

## 1. Two concepts, separated first

| Concept | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Session** | One running agent conversation; on disk it is an append-only event log |
| **Process** | One TUI terminal process |

The three front ends differ in essence, and that difference is where every
design decision below starts:

- **webui**: a background service process hosts sessions. Close that service
  window and every session stops at once. One machine runs **one** of them.
- **gui**: the whole application hosts sessions. Close the app (or kill its
  tray background) and every session stops at once. One machine runs **one**.
- **tui**: the TUI **is** the terminal process. Close it and the sessions it
  hosts stop. One machine can run **several** TUIs at the same time.

That last row is the source of all the complexity here: a TUI is both a process
and a container that can host several sessions. **Several such containers can
coexist on one machine**.

Everything webui and gui avoid by being globally unique, a TUI has to solve
directly.

## 2. The one model: a terminal hosts several sessions

One TUI process = one terminal + one **mount set**: the session currently
attached, plus every **parked** session.

Parking is not pausing and not "save and close" — a parked session **is still
alive and still running inside this process** (an in-flight turn keeps
generating); the terminal is simply not showing its transcript right now.

Three rules follow:

1. **Switching a session changes what you look at, not what is running.**
   Leaving a session parks it; it stays in the mount set and stays visible and
   switchable on the session screen.
2. **A running turn is not a reason to refuse a switch.** The user is choosing
   what to look at, not asking the model to stop. The turn keeps running in the
   background and its row keeps reporting progress.
3. **Exiting the terminal process clears the mount set.** No process supervisor,
   no pretence that a session outlives its terminal (gui's tray-style background
   is not how a TUI works). Session logs are durable, so `/resume` brings them
   back next time.

### 2.1 Why there used to be two models

`/resume` was **tui-style** and `/agentview` was **gui/webui-style**:

- **`/resume`**: switching **stopped the current session immediately**
  (`keepCurrent=false`, the old handle was `dispose`d), and it refused outright
  while a turn was running.
- **`/agentview`**: switching left the current session running, parked on this
  process's background-handle ledger; only exiting the process stopped them.

Neither was a wrong design. They were a historical accident of two commands
growing separately. That is why they kept needing patches against each other
on one shared `resumeTo`, and why users had to learn two mental models.

The model that survived is the overview's. It is the only one consistent with
what a TUI terminal actually is.

The channel layer already had the capability (`backgroundHandles` + the
agent-view projection).

`/resume`, `/home`, `/agentview`, `/bg` and the 🏠 button left of the composer
now all land on one screen and one set of actions. They are entries kept for
muscle memory, not four features.

## 3. The cross-process occupancy protocol

### 3.1 The problem

Two TUI processes can each `/resume` the same session id. The DSH session store
has no idea *who is currently driving a log*, so the two processes interleave
writes into **one append-only event log** and corrupt the transcript.

That is not a UX problem; it is data loss.

### 3.2 Who owns what: `~/.dsh-tui/session-mounts.json`

Every TUI process publishes one record naming the sessions it currently has
mounted:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "owners": [
    { "pid": 12345, "startedAt": 1789361300000,
      "sessionIds": ["<sessionId>", "..."] }
  ]
}
```

The source of truth for ownership is **pid**: while that process exists, the
record still counts as live.

`host` / `instance` are deliberately not part of the record. A home directory
can be shared over a network, but genuinely deciding across machines needs a
transport-level protocol, not a field written to a local disk.

Pid reuse only makes a session that is in fact free look occupied (one restart
fixes it); the opposite error interleaves two writers into one log.

Write discipline (the pattern already proven in `src/sessionPins.ts`):

- **Cross-process lock**: `session-mounts.lock` (`wx` exclusive create). The
  lock file holds `<pid>-<random nonce>`: the nonce decides "is this lock
  mine?", the pid decides "may this lock still be taken?".
- **Atomic replace**: `session-mounts.json.<pid>.<ts>.<seq>.tmp` + `rename`, so
  a reader never observes a half-written document.
- **A reclaimed holder must not write**: a writer whose lock was reclaimed has
  to notice that the lock is no longer its own, and abandon the commit. On the
  way out, delete only its OWN lock rather than the new holder's.
- **Only a provably dead holder is reclaimed**:
  - a lock whose pid is still ALIVE is never taken, however old the file is.
    Only a dead pid (or a token that cannot be read at all, past
    `STALE_LOCK_MS` — the create-then-write window) is reclaimable.
  - reclaiming on mtime alone steals the lock from a holder that was merely
    paused, and when it resumes it can commit a snapshot derived before the
    steal.
  - the price is pid REUSE: if an unrelated process recycles a dead holder's
    pid, that lock can no longer be reclaimed automatically and
    `session-mounts.lock` has to be removed by hand once every process sharing
    the data directory has stopped.
- **Permissions**: directory `0700`, file `0600`.
- **Display may be best-effort; granting may not**: the screen reads the ledger
  tolerantly (a damaged document reads as empty — showing fewer rows beats
  crashing the screen). The paths that DECIDE whether a mount may proceed read
  it strictly (see 3.4).
- **No failure may degrade into "assume nobody holds it"** — that is the one
  unrecoverable mistake.

### 3.3 Liveness has exactly one witness: the pid

A record is live if and only if `process.kill(pid, 0)` holds (`EPERM` counts as
alive too).

There is **no heartbeat timestamp**: a timestamp is only trustworthy while a
timer keeps refreshing it, and the process that cannot refresh it is exactly
the record that should expire.

One witness gives one answer instead of two that can contradict each other.

| Situation | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Clean exit (including `Ctrl+C`) | The teardown funnel calls `clearOwnMounts()`; the record is deleted and the sessions are mountable by another tui **immediately** |
| `kill -9` / terminal force-closed / power loss | The pid is gone, so the next read ignores the record |
| Pid reused | The record reads as occupied until that unrelated process exits |

The known cost is stated in the module header: this ledger is a **same-machine**
visibility layer, not the write authority — the host's own session write lock is
what separates writers.

**The read path never writes back.** Reads only filter; cleanup happens on the
write path.

Filtering a lock-free snapshot and writing it back drops any record a peer
published in between — `rename` atomicity prevents half a file, not a lost
update.

So "self-healing on read" would degrade into "deleting a peer's claim on
read".

### 3.4 Check and claim are one step

Mounting a session with no live agent in this process must go:

1. read the ledger (`readSessionOwners`) as a **pre-filter**, only so the user
   can be told which pid holds the session.
2. if free, call `reserveMount(sessionId)`: inside the cross-process lock it
   STRICTLY re-reads the file and re-derives the conflict. A conflict writes
   **nothing**; success splices its own fresh record into the current file and
   pins the session for the duration of this operation.
3. only then `await` the resume workflow. It ends one of two ways: `settle()`
   on a commit (the agent registry is the authority from then on), `abandon()`
   on every path that does not commit.

"Check, then publish" is **not atomic across processes**: two processes can each
observe `free` at step 1 and then publish in turn, leaving two live holders of
one session in the ledger. Step 2 is what makes the admission decision real.

**Three refusals, kept apart** (`MountFailure`):

| Result | Meaning | Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `occupied` + `holders` | A live holder, by pid | Report "held by pid N", refuse |
| `busy` | A peer holds the short lock, so the check **did not happen** | Bounded backoff (25–400ms), then refuse and ask the user to retry |
| `unavailable` + `detail` | The ledger cannot be read or written, so the check **did not happen** | Refuse with the reason (a damaged file names the manual repair) |

The old shape folded the last two into `holders: []`, leaving callers to guess.
Boot then treated "could not check" as "nobody holds it" and resumed anyway —
which is precisely the mistake this ledger exists to prevent.

**An existing session refuses on all three; none of them fails open.** A
read-only home then costs one loud refusal, where guessing wrong costs an
unrecoverable interleaved log.

**The one exception is a session id that was just minted** (`/new`, `/bg`,
fork, rewind, model switch, boot create): it cannot be somebody else's, so a
refusal there is "could not announce it", not a conflict.

The create proceeds with a warning. Blocking a user from starting a new session
over a conflict that cannot exist is not what this ledger is for.

**Strict read vs. tolerant read.** `readMountLedgerStrict()` treats only ENOENT
as an initial empty ledger; anything else — unreadable, malformed JSON, unknown
version, a record whose shape is wrong — is `unavailable`.

A refusal **changes nothing on disk**: the record that failed to parse may be
another writer's only claim, so skipping it and rewriting the file would throw
away that peer's reservation for it.

**A reservation must outlive the waits.** The claim is committed before the
agent exists in the registry (a resume reads preset, route and workspace first)
while the publisher derives its set from the registry.

Publishing therefore unions the observable roster with the in-flight operations;
without that, this process's own heartbeat can erase the claim it just committed
and a peer reads `free`.

A reservation this call took is given back (`abandon()` → `releaseMount`) when
the switch is vetoed, the binding went stale, or the resume threw — including a
throwing `binding.adopt()`.

It is only released after the handle has actually finished closing
(`binding.abandon()` now awaits the underlying `dispose`), because releasing
earlier drops the occupancy while writes may still be in flight.

**A session that already has a live agent in this process neither checks
occupancy nor goes through live adoption**: it is the session currently
attached.

So entering again is an idempotent success that keeps the same Agent handle.

That short-circuit is load-bearing — handing `undefined` to the adoption
transaction takes its default `dispose` path, which STOPS the running session
and still reports success.

### 3.5 The screen contract

- A session held by **another** tui: **still listed**, but the row turns red,
  the state cell shows `⊘`, and the row ends with `held by pid <pid>`; entering
  reports `Another TUI terminal holds this session (pid <pid>); cannot enter`.
- A session held by **this** process (parked) is not "occupied": it must be
  switchable back from this screen.
- A free session that is not live here: enterable as normal.
- Occupancy is re-read from the ledger on the screen's own **2s** tick. The
  host must not capture a snapshot into a callback at render time, or a peer
  that exited leaves the row red and unclickable until some unrelated channel
  event happens to repaint.
- The **registry is not the whole store**: it can legitimately be empty (a bare
  composition mounts no workspace service, or a registration was removed while
  its logs stayed on disk).
- The screen must then fall back to a group derived from the sessions' own
  `cwd`, so those sessions stay visible and resumable — "no registration" is not
  "no history".

## 4. Refresh cost

Occupancy and live status are two in-memory/small-file reads, deliberately
separate from re-listing sessions (backend enumeration plus cached summaries).
Summaries first reuse matching backend revisions. A changed revision triggers
a check of the artifact identity, size, and high-resolution modification/change
times. Historical revisions can change with the whole corpus; unchanged files
retain their summaries and title-recovery progress. Appends, rewrites, and
replacements invalidate that reuse. Older indexes without an artifact stamp
re-read on their next revision miss.

Successful complete JSONL listings are also saved privately under
`~/.dsh-tui/session-lists/`, scoped by backend, absolute root, and encoding.
After restart the first frame uses this snapshot while the count line says
“refreshing”. Resume and occupancy checks still use the runtime; a cached row
is not authorization. Failed refreshes retain the previous list beside an
error; a successful empty list clears the snapshot. Unknown backends, relative
roots, and corrupt snapshots do not reuse it. The first upgrade or an absent
snapshot still needs backend enumeration, then derives recent rows first in
yielding batches. Only the final complete result is saved.

| Data | Source | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mount-set publish (write) | `publishMounts`, one small lock-guarded file write | `PUBLISH_INTERVAL_MS` = **15s** |
| On-screen live status / occupancy (read) | The channel's agent-view projection snapshot + the ledger | The screen's own **2s** tick, `setState` only |
| Session listing | `listSessions()` | Once when the screen opens, plus manual `Ctrl+L` |

All three follow the repository's existing resource discipline:

- Every timer is `.unref()`d; it must never be the reason a process cannot exit.
- Every timer is cleaned up through `ctx.effect` / the `owner.own` funnel.
- The read path never touches the file: dead records are filtered in memory and
  actually pruned by the next write.

There is no memory growth: the ledger holds (processes × their mounted session
ids) and is rewritten wholesale on each publish.

Live status reads the projection snapshot the channel already maintains,
rather than creating a new subscription.

## 5. Relationship to dpx isolated environments

TUIs created by dpx are **fully isolated** from each other, and isolated runtime
state is written under **each environment's own home path**:

- The session ledger path is `join(homedir(), '.dsh-tui')`
  (`src/utils/paths.ts`), and a dpx isolation rewrites `HOME` / `USERPROFILE`,
  so each environment's `.dsh-tui` naturally lands inside its own environment
  root and **cannot** see another environment's mount records.
- The session-log root is `$DSH_HOME/sessions`, again per-environment.

Consequently: **multiple TUIs in the same environment see and protect each
other; different environments do not interfere at all**.

That is exactly what "an isolated environment's TUI is not disturbed by
another's runtime" means in practice: cross-environment collisions on a session
id cannot arise, because even the session store root differs.

## 6. Invariants (keep these when changing this area)

1. **One log is driven by one process at a time.**
   - The admission decision must be made inside the cross-process lock
     (`claimMount`: re-read + conflict re-check + claim write in one step),
     never as a lock-free "check, then publish".
   - Re-entering a session this process already hosts must short-circuit
     idempotently and must never take a path that disposes the handle.
2. **Switching a session never destroys it.** Park, do not `dispose`; a running
   turn is not interrupted by a switch.
3. **A claim must never be locked forever.** Every record must be reclaimable by
   "pid gone". A state that requires manual unlocking is forbidden.
4. **Same-machine scope must stay explicit.** Ownership is pid-only. Do not use
   a local `host` / `instance` field to pretend the ledger decides across
   machines — two machines sharing a home directory need a transport-level
   protocol, not this layer.
5. **Only the holder writes or releases the lock, and only a dead holder loses
   it.**
   - Each acquisition writes `<pid>-<nonce>` into the lock file; a holder that
     lost the lock must abandon its commit, and a release may delete only its
     own lock.
   - A lock whose pid is still alive is NEVER reclaimed, however old the file
     looks — the accepted cost is a pid-reused lock needing manual removal
     (see 3.2).
6. **Display reads tolerantly; deciding reads strictly.**
   - Missing file, corrupt JSON, wrong version, wrong field types — the SCREEN
     reads all of those as empty; cleanup must re-read under the lock rather
     than committing a pre-lock snapshot.
   - The paths that grant a mount must do the opposite: only ENOENT is empty,
     everything else refuses, and a refusal writes nothing.
7. **A timer must never block exit.** `.unref()` plus funnel cleanup, both.
8. **The screen must not disagree with the runtime.** Whether a session can be
   entered is the runtime's decision; the screen only explains the reason one
   step earlier. Both paths share one set of words via
   `src/sessions/resumeFailure.ts`.
9. **The screen must not assume the registry is complete.**
   - Sessions in an empty registry or an unregistered directory stay visible
     and resumable.
   - A FAILING registry read must not discard the session listing that already
     succeeded.
   - Occupancy is re-read every tick instead of reusing a host render snapshot.
10. **The focus is one fact.** The session list's cursor is keyed by **sessionId**
    and every index is derived from it, so render, movement and Enter agree.
