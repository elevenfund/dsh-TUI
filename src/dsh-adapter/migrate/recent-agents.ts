/**
 * Recent foreign-agent activity detection for the migration hint.
 *
 * "Did the user just come from another coding agent?" is answered from file
 * mtimes inside each source store: an active conversation appends to its
 * log in real time (claude-code updates within the same minute), so the
 * NEWEST file mtime per source is a faithful last-activity signal with good
 * separation (measured on a real machine: 0min vs 117min vs 5867min across
 * sources). Parent-directory mtimes would miss appends to existing
 * conversations, so the scan is file-level — bounded by the same
 * name-matching walk as the list-mode counter (sub-second at ~3000 files)
 * and meant for a BACKGROUND pass, never the render path.
 *
 * Split: `recentAgentsFrom` is a pure judgment over collected samples
 * (directly testable with fixture mtimes); `collectNewestMtime` is the IO
 * collector; `detectRecentAgents` binds them for the TUI.
 *
