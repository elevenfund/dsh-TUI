/**
 * Lineage decision consulted by `/model` only.
 *
 * `/rewind` and the `/tree` branch also re-create the live session as a child,
 * but they always record `parentSession` and do not call this helper. A blank
 * log cannot reach them (`boundary < 0`). This module is not their gate.
 *
 * The decision is load-bearing beyond grouping. Upstream's automatic session
 * title only ever runs on a session WITHOUT a parent: `dsh-session-title`
 * schedules its provider on the first human message under
 * `session.header.parentSession === undefined`, and a session that already has
 * one is never offered a generated title again — a fork keeps the title it
 * inherited, and only an explicit `ctx.sessionTitle.refresh()` retries, which
 * no TUI surface calls. A route switch on a session nobody has typed into
 * would therefore cost that user the title of their first real prompt, leaving
 * the deterministic fallback instead (a mid-word truncation of the prompt at
 * `fallbackMaxBytes`).
 *
 * A session with no human message has no conversation for the lineage to
 * describe, so its replacement stands as its own root — the same independent-
 * conversation choice `/fork` already makes (`session-fork.ts`), for the same
 * reason. The seeded prefix is unaffected either way: the child still inherits
 * the source's session scaffolding verbatim.
 *
