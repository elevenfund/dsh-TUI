/**
 * Answered-questionnaire transcript record — a PURE fold of the durable
 * session log (issue #1009).
 *
 * `ask_user_question` renders as the interactive panel, not as a tool card,
 * so its `tool/result` had no renderer at all: the answers lived only in the
 * current process's view rows (the TUI used to push a summary when the panel
 * closed). That violated the transcript's source-of-truth rule — `/resume`,
 * rewind, `loadOlder` and any replay lost the record, and an ask that was
 * never observed closing produced none at all.
 *
 * The record now derives from the same log every other transcript row comes
 * from: the `tool/call` arguments carry the questions, the `tool/result`
 * payload carries the answers. Both are parsed at the caller's edge here, so
 * this module stays pure (no store, no i18n state, no projection imports) and
 * is directly testable.
