/**
 * The session index — a local cache keyed by the backend's own change token.
 *
 * Deriving a session's title costs a bounded read; doing it for every session
 * on every picker open costs that read times the history. The persistence
 * service already hands out the exact token needed to avoid it:
 * `listSnapshots()` returns, per session, an opaque revision that changes
 * whenever the stored log changes. An entry whose revision still matches is
 * reused verbatim. A changed logical revision can still reuse a summary when
 * its physical artifact stamp matches: historical revisions also depend on
 * other sessions, whereas these derived fields read only the located file.
 * A session edited by another client invalidates its artifact stamp.
 *
 * The revision is treated as opaque, as its contract requires. It happens to
 * be stat-derived today, but parsing it to shortcut a `stat` would couple this
 * cache to one backend's private format and break the moment a store without
 * per-session files is used.
 *
 * Two halves live in one entry because they have different lifetimes:
 * `derived` facts come from the log and are checked against its revision or
 * physical artifact stamp. `branch` is a local note about how this install
 * used the session and no log change can invalidate it.
 *
 * Every operation is best-effort. The index is a cache: a corrupt file, a
 * losing concurrent write, or a read-only home directory costs a re-derivation
 * and nothing else, so nothing here throws.
