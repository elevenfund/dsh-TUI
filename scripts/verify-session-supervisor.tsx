/**
 * verify-session-supervisor — the unified session screen (issue #879).
 *
 * `/resume`, `/agentview` and `/home` are one screen over one runtime now, and
 * the two properties worth a regression are the ones that used to be spread
 * across three implementations and drifted:
 *
 *   1. it is genuinely ONE surface — a workspace rail, the sessions of the
 *      selected workspace, and a live-state cell on every row, with the
 *      current session marked;
 *   2. a session held by ANOTHER TUI terminal is shown as occupied and cannot
 *      be entered: clicking it must NOT reach the channel's resume path, which
 *      is what would interleave two processes into one append-only log;
 *   3. the rail is the ledger and nothing else — no `+` row, because a
 *      workspace joins by being the directory a terminal started in (the
 *      startup attach), not by an in-screen picker.
 *
 * Plus the pure behaviours the screen leans on: the search predicate, and the
 * rail's window math.
 *
 * It also pins the snapshot-then-refresh first paint (issue #987): a mount
 * paints its channel's previous listing instead of a loading placeholder, and
 * the fresh listing corrects it wholesale when it lands. A rejected listing
 * keeps the previous snapshot beside its error notice — only a successful
 * listing ever writes the snapshot, and only the newest reload may (a listing
 * that lands late must not repaint over a newer one).
 *
 * The snapshot is keyed by the CHANNEL, so every case below owns one: a case
 * that wants a carried-over first frame mounts the SAME stub twice, and a case
 * that wants a cold one builds a fresh stub. No case inherits another's rows,
 * and none of them depends on where it sits in this file.
 *
 * Renders the real `SessionSupervisor` into an in-memory terminal with a stub
 * channel, then drives it with real stdin bytes (SGR mouse reports).
 *
 * Run: node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-session-supervisor.tsx
